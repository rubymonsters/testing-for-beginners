# Libraries

As mentioned, there are serveral libraries that make testing in Ruby much
easier, and more pleasant. Some of them are rather simple, and very fast.
Others are very powerful, and come with lots of useful features.

We'll look at the two most commonly used general purpose testing libraries:
MiniTest and RSpec.

Later we will then have a look at some libraries that have more specific
purposes, and help with testing in certain contexts.
