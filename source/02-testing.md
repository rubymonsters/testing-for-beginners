# Testing Code

Your code is supposed to function in a certain way. You expect that, whenever
used, when you input certain bits of data to it, you'll get a certain,
expected, output.

Tests are extra code that you write alongside your code. You use this extra code
to exercise, and test, your actual code, i.e. the code you really care about.
So you could also say that tests are meta code: code that sole purpose is to
test other code.

That sounds more complicated than it actually is.

We'll expore the basic concepts of testing by writing very simple tests first.
Later we'll look at libraries and services that make writing such tests more
easy and effective.
